# Dev Log - December 10, 2025

## Summary
Initial setup of Documentation-Driven Development (DDD) structure for the Sisyphus project.

## What Was Done

### DDD Structure Setup
- Created `./ddd/` folder for development progress tracking
- Created `./ddd/122025/` sprint folder for December 2025
- Moved `todo.md` from project root to `./ddd/todo.md`
- Initialized this dev log

### Documentation Review
- Reviewed existing `./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - comprehensive system architecture with diagrams
- Reviewed existing `./docs/PLAN.md` - tech stack decisions and roadmap

## Decisions Made
- Adopted DDD workflow for tracking development progress
- Sprint folders use `mmyyyy` format (e.g., `122025` for December 2025)
- Dev logs use `dev_log_ddmmyyyy.md` format

## Current State
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ (decided)
- **LLM Provider**: Copilot API (via GitHub Copilot subscription)
- **UX**: CLI/REPL (decided)
- **Tech Stack**: typer, pydantic, PyYAML, asyncio, pytest, ruff, pyright
- **Phase**: Pre-Phase 1 (project setup not started)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Begin Phase 1: Minimal Chat Completion
- [ ] Set up Python project structure (pyproject.toml, src layout)
- [ ] Configure development tooling (ruff, pyright, pytest)

## Blockers
None

## Notes
- ~~`PLAN.md` has some TBD markers that have been decided~~ Updated PLAN.md with final decisions

## Update: LLM Integration Research

### Copilot API Decision

Researched and documented the LLM integration approach. Instead of using Anthropic API directly, we'll use **Copilot API** - a reverse-engineered proxy that exposes GitHub Copilot as an Anthropic-compatible service.

**Key Points**:
- Uses Anthropic Messages API format (`/v1/messages`)
- Runs locally on `http://localhost:4141`
- Requires active GitHub Copilot subscription
- Can use `anthropic` Python SDK with custom base_url

**Documentation Created**:
- Created `./docs/llm-integration.md` with full API details
- Updated `./docs/PLAN.md` to reflect LLM provider decision
- Updated `./docs/README.md` index

See [llm-integration.md](../../docs/llm-integration.md) for implementation details.
