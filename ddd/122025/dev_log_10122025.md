# Dev Log - December 10, 2025

## Summary
Initial setup of Documentation-Driven Development (DDD) structure for the Sisyphus project.

## What Was Done

### DDD Structure Setup
- Created `./ddd/` folder for development progress tracking
- Created `./ddd/122025/` sprint folder for December 2025
- Moved `todo.md` from project root to `./ddd/todo.md`
- Initialized this dev log

### Documentation Review
- Reviewed existing `./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - comprehensive system architecture with diagrams
- Reviewed existing `./docs/PLAN.md` - tech stack decisions and roadmap

## Decisions Made
- Adopted DDD workflow for tracking development progress
- Sprint folders use `mmyyyy` format (e.g., `122025` for December 2025)
- Dev logs use `dev_log_ddmmyyyy.md` format

## Current State
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ (decided)
- **LLM Provider**: Anthropic Claude (decided, others later)
- **Tech Stack**: typer, pydantic, PyYAML, asyncio, pytest, ruff, pyright
- **Phase**: Pre-Phase 1 (project setup not started)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Begin Phase 1: Minimal Chat Completion
- [ ] Set up Python project structure (pyproject.toml, src layout)
- [ ] Configure development tooling (ruff, pyright, pytest)

## Blockers
None

## Notes
- `PLAN.md` has some TBD markers that have been decided (UX: CLI/REPL, LLM: Anthropic)
- Consider updating `PLAN.md` to reflect these decisions
