# Archive

This directory contains completed sprints.

## Naming Convention

Sprint folders follow the pattern: `sprint_XX_YYYY-MM-DD`
- `XX`: Two-digit sprint number
- `YYYY-MM-DD`: Sprint start date

## Contents

Each archived sprint contains:
- `sprint_info.md` - Sprint metadata and goals
- `backlog.md` - Final backlog state (should be empty)
- `completed.md` - All completed tasks with notes
- `retrospective.md` - Sprint retrospective (if conducted)
